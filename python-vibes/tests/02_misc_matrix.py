#The name "dot product" is derived from the dot operator " â‹… " that is often used to designate this operation;[1] the alternative name "scalar product" emphasizes that the result is a scalar, rather than a vector (as with the vector product in three-dimensional space).

#Vectors are represented as matrices. But a matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers and nothing else.
